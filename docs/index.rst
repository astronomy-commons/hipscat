HATS - Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme
========================================================================================

HATS is a directory structure and metadata for spatially arranging large catalog survey data. 
This was originally motivated by a desire to perform spatial cross-matching between surveys 
at large scale, but is applicable to a range of spatial analysis and algorithms.

We use healpix (`Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization <https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/>`_)
for the spherical pixelation, and adaptively size the partitions based on the number of objects.
Each partition will have roughly the same number of objects, instead of dividing into equal area. 
Because each partition is roughly the same size on disk, we can expect reasonable performance of 
parallel operations on each partition.

We use parquet as the underlying storage format, as it provides efficient storage and retrieval 
of tabular data.

The ``hats`` python package provides basic access to a catalog's metadata, and shared functionality
for interacting with the healpix space. This allows for multiple libraries to implement parallel 
operations on top of these utilities. Some known extensions:

* `LSDB <https://lsdb.readthedocs.io/>`_ - Large Survey Database - A framework for scalable 
  spatial analysis using ``dask`` for job scheduling and execution.
* `hats-import <https://hats-import.readthedocs.io/>`_ - map reduce pipelines for converting
  large or custom catalogs into HATS format.
