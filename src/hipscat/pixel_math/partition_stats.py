    We may initially find healpix pixels at order 10, but after aggregating up to the pixel

    This method can be slower than the above `_get_alignment` method, and so should only be used

    This uses a form of hiearchical agglomeration (building a tree bottom-up). For each cell
    at order n, we look at the counts in all 4 subcells at order (n+1). We have two numeric
    values that are easy to compute that we can refer to easily:

    - quad_sum: the total number of counts in this cell
    - quad_max: the largest count within the 4 subcells

    Our agglomeration criteria (the conditions under which we collapse) must BOTH be met:

    - total number in cell is less than the global threshold (quad_sum <= threshold)
    - more than one subcell contains values (quad_sum != quad_max) (if exactly 1
      subcell contains counts, then all of the quad_sum will come from that single quad_max)
